Ganeca is a custom typeface family commissioned by [Lost & Fond Creative Playground](https://www.instagram.com/lostfond.pg/) for the Corporate of ITB Enterprise, based on the SORA by Barnbrook Fonts. Designed as a branding and interface solution, every decision in its development was made with todayâ€™s crisp digital environments in mind. A large x-height and generous counters make the family highly effective for app and web interfaces, ensuring clarity at any size. The result is a neutral yet distinctive sans serif typeface that delivers excellent legibility across diverse mediums.

The Ganeca typeface is an open-source project and available for download and use following the Open Font License (OFL).
